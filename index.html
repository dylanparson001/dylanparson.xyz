    <p id="aboutme">Hi! My name is Dylan Parson, I am currently pursuing a career in IT. This website will mostly be to document my progress. 
        The main things that interest me about technology are system administration, specifically in scripting and automation. Web development is also
        something that I am interested in and will be building this site from scratch, mainly for fun and to see what I can accomplish.
